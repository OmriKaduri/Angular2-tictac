# Angular 2 implementation of tic-tac-toe game 

This project is my experimental playground of [Angular 2](https://angular.io/). **DEMO** is found [here](https://tic-tac-toe-emxlsggdqu.now.sh/);

This project is part of my journey to learn Angular 2 and React, and it also has a [sibling](https://github.com/OmriKaduri/Angular2-tictac) project which implements the same tic-tac-toe game exactly at React & Redux.

Currently, it only implements the classic tic-tac-toe game, without any implementation of algorithm for "Play against the computer" mode.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running the tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## The goal for this project are:
1. Implement a simple minimax algorithm for "Play against the computer" mode.
2. Add tests.
3. Make it an [ultimate-tic-tac-toe](http://vikeshkhanna.webfactional.com/ultimate/)! 

## Cool features

1. You can extend the size of the [Board](https://github.com/OmriKaduri/Angular2-tictac/blob/master/src/app/Board/board.component.ts), by changing it's `sideLength` Input .
2. That's it. Cool, isn't it? :relieved:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.
